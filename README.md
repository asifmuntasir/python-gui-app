This are my Operating System and System Programming Lab project.
Here I've used Python tkinter for UI. In OS_2.py I've made an app to findout all types of files like as .pdf, .exe, .txt etc. from a selected directory.
And the shutdown.py I've made an app to restart, sleep and shutdown pc by clicking specific button.
